# Election Analysis

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to dig further into election results to complete an audit as requested by the election commission. The additional info requested was:

* The voter turnout for each county
* The percentage of votes from each county out of total vote count
* The county with the highest turnout

I used python and election data resources from the election comission to determine the requested outcomes.



### Results

* There were 369,711 total votes cast in this congressional election.

* Here is a breakdown of votes by county. Denver County had the largest percentage of votes cast by far out of the three counties, with 82.8% of all votes cast, a total of 306,055 votes out of the total.

* With 272,892 votes, Diana DeGette received the most votes out of all three candidates, for a total percentage of 73.8% of all votes. Charles Casper Stockham received 23% of votes cast, and Raymon Anthony Doan received only 3.1% of all votes.

### Summary

This election audit provides a very simplified look at the results of this election. This code could easily be adapted to do an audit of another location's election results. We would simply need to read in a different or additional CSV file with the election data and make a few adaptations to the code for a generalized audit. Depending on the data file, further analysis could be done on the data as well, including looking at things like how individual counties voted for candidates, or a look into data for propositions and not just politicians.
